# Introduction

Kotlin is a brand new world, with quiet a lot of new feature. One of them is **conventions**. 
Kotlin documentation said that if you define an `operator` function `plus`, you can use `+`, _by convention_, to call
 that function. 
 
Conventions are not just for operators, you'll find them in Collections, Ranges, Destructive Declaration and invocation.
